<p>
    Magic The Gathering is a card game like poker, except every 6 months new 
    cards come out in the form of a "set" that add new rules of the game. 
    Around 300 new cards are invented and published, and these new cards 
    change the way the game is played. For this reason, some cards come in and out of fashion.
