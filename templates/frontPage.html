This application scrapes scryfall for Magic the Gathering card information and prices. It uses Flask, sqlite, highcarts, and bootstrap to display charts and tables of that data.</p>
<p>The objective of this application is to track price information and alert the user when a card spikes in value. Also, the application informs them of associated cards that may also increase in value.
I gather pricing data daily of both the normal and foil version, I gather popularity from edhrec.com, and I plan to scrape ebay for daily average supply of cards to monitor the supply/demand. I also
calculate the average weekly price and standard deviation of cards to tell if they are increasing or decreasing in value over time. The user is informed to buy a card that is climbing (or plateaued)
in value, as well as sell if the price is dropping.</p> <p>The languages I used for this application include: python, html, javascript, and sql.
